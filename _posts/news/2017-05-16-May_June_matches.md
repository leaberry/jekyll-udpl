In May we have the IDPA match which will be a full 10 stage match with extras. Early June is the Berrys Cedar Valley Multigun match and late June is the newest match format, a Black Rifle match.

## May 27th IDPA match

This is a normal Tier 1 match but we will have some extras. Certificates will be handed out for those that place and there will be random prize drawings as well. It's 10 stages, about 150 rounds, and there are lots of spots available still. A [preliminary course of fire can be seen here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1kXyOUv65KcOCTOf8NL8kcLCp-vQ7YX51wSkcVhwGAs4/edit#slide=id.g21ad449e14_1_90)

### June 3rd and 4th Berrys Cedar Valley Multigun

This is a two day match, Saturday and Sunday June 3-4. Staff shoot Friday June 2nd. We will need help all week prior setting up so come out to the range and help if you can.

Match fee is $100 and there will be 10 stages of fast paced multi-gun action, running the same format as the Expedition multi-gun in Las Vegas. We will be running the new rule and divisions found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1i7rn0rwTHmQM4jsJ9md0870yVp0Xqst96MFLLi1WdOk)

Divisions: Tac, Limited, Heavy , Open, PCC (shooting the entire match with 1 PCC gun), 2 Gun (shoot the entire match Rifle/Pistol) and 2X4 (using Rifle, Pistol, Shot Gun and PCC. Must use 2 guns per stage, shooters choice. All open rules)

Rather than a prize table after the match, we will do a quick awards with some random draw prizes mixed in. Through out the match the prize patrol will be roving around to each squad with give away's and a drawing for a substantial prize or two.

### June 24th Black rifle match

This is a new format that uses only a semi-automatic rifle. No pistol needed. Ideally an AR-15 or AK-47 should be your choice but any semi-automatic rifle will work. There are also divisions for Pistol Caliber Carbines and rimfire rifles. You'll engage targets from 5 to 150 yards from a variety of positions. Plan on 200 rounds of ammo and like all rifle matches the **bullet must not be steel**. If it sticks to a magnet you can't shoot it.
