The matches in May were a success. Despite being one of the wettest months on record the IDPA state match managed to avoid the rain. The 3 Gun match the week before was not as lucky. The results for both matches have been posted. The best way to thank the teams that design and setup the matches is to stay after a few minutes and help cleanup. It goes 10 times faster when everyone makes two trips to the conex hauling things rather than the same 8 people every time making 10 trips.
