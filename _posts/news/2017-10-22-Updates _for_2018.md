October has an IDPA match and some announcements about 2018 changes.

## October 28th IDPA match

This will be a fun 7 stage match based on books written by Michael Crichton. Plenty of space available and the weather will be sunny. Not too late to sign up and enjoy a fall day shooting. Even though it's not quite the end of daylight savings time the match will use winter hours. Arrive around 9AM, 9:30AM is the new shooters meeting and match starts at 10AM. The tenative [stages can be viewed here](http://www.udpl.net/files/cofs/2017-10_IDPA.pdf)

If you'd like to help setup Friday afternoon (and shoot the match free!) contact Daniel <leaberry@gmail.com> for details.

## 2018 schedule

We have a tenative schedule for 2018. Once we've booked the range bays we will publicize the schedule. First match will be January 1st with the Steel Challenge match. The Terrys can always use help setting up the day before and the [UDPL Facebook page](http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=104429186260375&ref=ts) is a common place to arrange help setting up.

We plan on doing very similar matches to 2017 with possibly a trial new format handgun match and two Black Rifle matches since the first one was so popular.


## 2018 IDPA changes

We have decided to have IDPA matches for another year. However the year will be a test to determine whether or not to continue offering IDPA matches. They have the lowest turnout out of any of our matches and the support within the club seems to be lacking. If you want to see us continue to have IDPA matches we want to see you during 2018 at the matches. Bring a new shooter too. IDPA might seem intimidating but the rules have been vastly simplified and during local club matches we are flexible with equipment rules.

Daniel Leaberry has volunteered to be match director for the 2018 year and is looking for some assistant match directors. If you like to shoot IDPA, are available most Friday afternoons before the match to help setup, and want the fun and glamour that designing stages can be, please contact him directly at <leaberry@gmail.com>


## Funshoots

As always we have the Rangemasters Funshoot twice during the month. Details are in the [schedule](http://www.udpl.net/schedule/).
