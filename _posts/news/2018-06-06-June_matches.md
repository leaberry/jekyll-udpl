June has the Black Rifle match and the Cedar Valley Multigun District 2 Championships


## June 16th Black Rifle match

Black Rifle matches are a timed Practical Shooting match run with a modern semi-auto rifle. Distances are between 5 yards and 100 yards.

Typically a Black Rifle match will require between 80 and 120 rounds of ammo to complete. Because we shoot steel targets, **NO STEEL CORE OR BI-METAL AMMUNITION ALLOWED:** if the bullet sticks to a magnet, you canâ€™t shoot it here. If you are found to be using either, you will be disqualified and assessed any target replacement fees deemed necessary.
