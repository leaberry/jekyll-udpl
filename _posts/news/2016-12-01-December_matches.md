We have our Handgun match on the *second* Saturday of the month (December 10th) and we'll be using the winter hours (arrive around 9AM, match starts at 10AM). There will also be a Sunday match January 1st 2017 with more details to follow. Probably a Steel Challenge match.

## December 10th Handgun Match

Round count is about 200 rounds. Dress for the weather. If you can come the day before (Dec 9th) at 1PM we could use the assistance setting up the match. Many hands make light work. [Register on Practiscore](https://practiscore.com/udpl-december-2016-handgun-match/register).

## January 1st Steel Challenge (probably)

Steel Challenge has a specific fixed course of fire which is detailed [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steel_Challenge). This match *will be held on Sunday* due to New Years day falling on a Sunday this year. Registration will be on Practiscore (link coming soon).


## Funshoots

As always we have the Rangemasters Funshoot twice during the month. Details are in the [schedule](http://www.udpl.net/schedule/).
