The round count for the Super Shoot will be 12 stages 30 rounds per stage. Plan on bringing 500 rounds. Additionally we will need help setting up the match. If you can come help setup Friday August 21st please email [Jim Smith](mailto:jsmith@ipaperbox.com)

If you are registered there is no need to show up to sign in. Just arrive at your bay by 8AM prepared to shoot. We will start promptly at 8AM. Your starting bay is your squad number. If you need to make a change or other registration type issue we will have someone there at 7AM to handle these minor changes.

There will be no hard stop for lunch. Eat lunch while shooting and bring sunscreen along with plenty of water. Prizes will be after the completion of the match. Along with various prizes we will be giving away 4-5 handguns. **You must be present to win any firearms.** Any out of state transfers will be $30.

It will be a fun match with almost exclusively steel targets. If you have a portable shade canopy you will be welcomed by all your squad mates if you bring it and set it up. The sun is hot.
