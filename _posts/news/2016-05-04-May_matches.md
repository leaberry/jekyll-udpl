Only one match this month, the IDPA state match. There is also a meeting regarding the BLM land closure near Saratoga Springs.

## May 28th Utah State IDPA Match

Our big IDPA match for the year is always exciting and has the most innovative stage designs. You can [register at Practiscore](https://practiscore.com/2016-utah-state-idpa-championship/register). We will have 10 fantastic stages and lunch will be provided.

## May 11th BLM Meeting

For the past 3 years sections of BLM land near Saratoga Springs and Lake Mountain have been closed to target shooting. The BLM cannot indefinitely close an area without going through more hoops so the closures have been temporary and renewed each year. They have 3 proposals to permanently deal with the issue.

* Do nothing, current closures will lapse
* Keep the current 893 acres closed permanently
* Expand the closure to 3450 acres permanently

More details are available [here](https://www.nraila.org/articles/20160420/utah-blm-proposes-to-close-thousands-of-acres-in-utah-county-to-target-shooting). There is a meeting that the public can attend to comment and express preference for the 3 proposals.

    Talons Cove Golf Club
    2220 S Talons Cove Drive
    Saratoga Springs, UT 84045
    6PM-8PM

The BLM gave 150 acres to Utah county to make a shooting range (Soldier Pass Shooting Range) but the range has not been built yet.

## Safety Officer Training

May 14th we will be having Safety Officer training in Payson. If you have been shooting for a while and would like to be a safety officer this is a great chance to become officially certified. IDPA certified safety officers can also be safety officers for local UDPL club matches. As a safety officer you enjoy discounted match fees and help keep our matches safe and running smoothly. You must be an IDPA member to be an IDPA safety officer.

If you have no interest in IDPA but want to become a UDPL club certified safety officer you can take the course as well. You will only be certified as a Safety Officer at the local UDPL matches. If the class fills up preference will be given to IDPA members.

* Date: May 14th 9AM-5PM
* Location: Payson, Utah - Address TBD
* Cost $20
* Includes lunch
* Maximum of 12 people
