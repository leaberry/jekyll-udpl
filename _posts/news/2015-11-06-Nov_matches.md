There were October matches, I just didn't get an announcement out in time. I figure everyone knows how to use the schedule link on the website.

We have one club match in November, the ICORE match. This is a revolver friendly match so if you want to shoot a revolver the divisions are setup for that. Semi automatic handguns are also welcome to shoot the match.


## Funshoot on Nov 4th and 17th

As always we have the Rangemasters Funshoot twice during the month. Details are in the schedule.


## Nov 28th ICORE match

Important to note that we've switched over to winter hours for our matches now. So sign in starts at 9AM and the match starts at 10AM. This match will be predominently steel and may be quite cold. Dress appropriately.
