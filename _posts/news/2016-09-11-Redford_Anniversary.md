Saturday September 17th we would like to invite you all to come out to Red and Judy Redford's 50th anniversary Open House. Come and enjoy friends, refreshments, and red pens. Have a little walk down memory lane, because we all know that Red is to old to run down anything :-) Come meet the woman who has put up with him for the last 50 years. You've shot matches with him, now come shoot the breeze with him.  The new friend orientation meeting will be promptly at 4:45 in the hallway and the pre anniversary safety meeting will start promptly at 5. No gifts are necessary, however reloading money is always accepted :-)

* Saturday September 17th, 5-7PM
* LDS Church 950 S 50 E Orem, UT 84058 [Google Map](https://goo.gl/maps/cFntMBvGRmT2)
