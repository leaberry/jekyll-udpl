Big thanks to the club members who participated and helped with the Cedar Valley Multigun match. It was a great match and it certainly wouldn't have been as fun if we hadn't had so much help.

A reminder that if you want to become an IDPA/club safety officer you can contact Daniel Leaberry <leaberry@gmail.com>. The course is Saturday July 11th. More details are [here](http://www.udpl.net/announcements/idpa-safety-officer-training/)


## Rifle/Pistol July 18th

If you're intimidated by 3 Gun the rifle/pistol match is a great chance to test out the concept. It's also a popular match to shoot with a .22lr gun or pistol caliber carbine. Remember there is no steel ammo allowed for safety reasons. If a magnet sticks to the bullet (not the case) you won't be able to shoot that ammo.

## IDPA July 25th

Please check your range bag to see if you have an extra 9mm Wilson Combat magazine. RDan Phillips is missing one and would love to get it back. You can email him at <rdanph45@gmail.com>
