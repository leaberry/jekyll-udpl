Spring is almost here and we have a 3 Gun match and an IDPA match this month. We are also switching over to summer hours this month to take advantage of the daylight. **All matches this month start at 9AM with check-in starting at 8AM.**

## March 19th 3 Gun Match

There will be a 3 Gun match March 19th. Signup is open and going fast. You can [register on practiscore](https://practiscore.com/udpl-march-3-gun-1/register). Remember there is a price difference for the match. $20 if you are a UDPL member, $30 if you are not. You can join UDPL while checking in. All fees are listed [on the website](http://www.udpl.net/about/#toc2)


## March 26th IDPA Match

This match will include the IDPA classifier and is a great match to ensure you are classified and ready to shoot the state match in May. You should make sure all your equipment meets IDPA rules when you come to the match. The classifier is 90 rounds and frequently people make mistakes and have to reshoot it. Bring enough ammo.

## Safety Officer Training

May 14th we will be having Safety Officer training in Payson. If you have been shooting for a while and would like to be a safety officer this is a great chance to become officially certified. IDPA certified safety officers can also be safety officers for local UDPL club matches. As a safety officer you enjoy discounted match fees and help keep our matches safe and running smoothly. You must be an IDPA member to be an IDPA safety officer.

If you have no interest in IDPA but want to become a UDPL club certified safety officer you can take the course as well. You will only be certified as a Safety Officer at the local UDPL matches. If the class fills up preference will be given to IDPA members.

* Date: May 14th 9AM-5PM
* Location: Payson, Utah - Address TBD
* Cost $20
* Includes lunch
* Maximum of 12 people
