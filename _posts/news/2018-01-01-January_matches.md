January 27th is the IDPA match and we need people to come to the match! Turnout has been low for IDPA matches and we can't continue to run matches for 20-30 people 6 times a year. If you like IDPA please show up to shoot the match.

## January 27th - IDPA Match

It's cold in January, we all know that. But you can still have fun shooting matches! Those little chemical handwarmers last for the whole match and your hands and feet will be so warm you won't mind not wearing gloves so you can tape targets! The match will be at least 6 fun filled stages. [Register on Practiscore](https://practiscore.com/udpl-2018-january-idpa-match/register)
