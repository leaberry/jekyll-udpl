August is our annual "SuperShoot" which is a high round count, all day pistol match. This year we're doing something different and **only accepting payment online**. This is so we can get the match started on time. The cost will be $40 per shooter. When you register there will be a delay (24 hours or so) in receiving the payment link until you are approved into the match. No one will receive a squad link until payment is made.

Registration for the SuperShoot will start August 1st. The match fills up fast. You can [register here](https://clubs.practiscore.com/2015-udpl-super-shoot/register)
