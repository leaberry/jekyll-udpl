## Paving the range

Our club President, Jim Smith, has a message about an opportunity to prevent more flat tires when coming to our matches at the Farm.

"I got a call from Ryan Nell, the owner of the Farm Range, and he has acquired enough Rotomill asphalt to pave a road from the back 40 range to the entrance of the range.

West Jordan City is coordinating this project with the Farm Range, it will be completed some time in July. They are asking all users of the Farm Range to help pay for fuel for the 200 + dump trucks of materials that are needed to complete the road.

I have gotten approval from UDPL officers to match ALL donations from members with UDPL funds.

There will be a donation jar at all UDPL Matches, if it is not possible to donate at a match the club will also be accepting donations thru my Paypal account <roysmiths@msn.com>, or please send checks to UDPL at my home address.
