August had the Supershoot and I didn't send out any notices. Everyone figured it out though. September has three matches this month, the annual BUG gun match in the afternoon Sept 17th, and the night match the evening of Sept 17th. There is also a 3 gun match Sept 24th.

## September 17th BUG/Night match

This is two matches on the same day. Shoot the Backup Gun (BUG) match in the afternoon and stick around until night time if you want to shoot the night match portion. This is a great chance to get real world practice with your carry gun or nightstand gun in a dark environment.
