July has UML Multigun and IDPA matches. Additionally the Colorado State IDPA match is open for signup.


## July 14th UML Multigun

We have a multigun match this month. Remember that UML multigun is highly flexible with the way you shoot it. You can shoot rifle/pistol, rifle/pcc, pcc only, traditional 3 gun, 2x4 gun, lots of different ways to do it. [Sign up on practiscore](https://www.practiscore.com/udpl-july-uml-match/register)

## August 25th Colorado State IDPA Match

Located near Grand Junction, CO at the new Cameo Shooting and Education facility there will be the IDPA Colorado State Match. 12 stages with 202 rounds, t-shirt and lunch included. You can [register on practiscore](https://www.practiscore.com/2018-co-state-idpa-championship/register). They are specifically looking for IDPA certified Safety Officers as well. Probably the shortest drive to another State IDPA Match for the rest of the year.


## Funshoots
