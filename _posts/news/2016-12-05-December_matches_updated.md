Couple of updates for the matches this month. Setup will be 8AM on Saturday now for the Handgun match and bring a WML/flashlight for the Funshoot on the 7th.

## December 10th Handgun Match

Dress for the weather because it looks like rain and snow. Instead of setting up on Friday we'll be setting up Saturday morning starting at 8AM. Due to the weather we're planning on making it an all steel match and avoiding falling steel as well. There will only be six stages, all in the upper area bays by the clubhouse so setup should be fast. Please come early and help.

## January 1st Steel Challenge (for sure)

Steel Challenge has a specific fixed course of fire which is detailed [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steel_Challenge). This match *will be held on Sunday* due to New Years day falling on a Sunday this year. [Register on Practiscore](https://practiscore.com/udpl-jan-1-2017-steel-challenge/register)


## Funshoot for Dec 7th

Lastly, the Funshoot December 7th will have two low light stages. Bring a weapon mounted light or a flashlight.
