We have two matches this month, on summer time, Multigun on the 17th and ICORE on the 24th. The May IDPA state match is a sanctioned Tier 2 match now and Safety Officer Training happens in April.

## March 17th - Multigun Match

Multigun has some updated rules and divisions in the 2018 year. You can [read all the rules](http://unitedmultigunleague.com/uml-rules/) if you'd like more details.

The match is [available for signup on practiscore](https://practiscore.com/march-2018-uml-match/register) and will be 5 great stages of approximately 45 rounds each. Match will use our summer hours, so show up at 8AM for sign-in and we'll be shooting at 9AM.

The registration for the [2018 UML Cedar Valley Multigun District 2 championships](https://practiscore.com/cedar-valley-2018-uml-district-2-championships-sponsored-by-berrys-mfg/register) is also open as well. These are great matches and a lot of work goes into the planning and setup.


## March 24th - ICORE

ICORE caters to revolver shooters and there are 6 categories for revolvers. But our ICORE directors also like semi-auto shooters so there are 3 divisions if you'd rather not shoot a revolver. It will be 9 stages and 2 of them will be official ICORE stages with the ICORE scoring and targets. You can [read all about ICORE rules](http://www.icore.org/pdf/ICORE_Rule_Book_1_January_2018.pdf) in their 2018 rulebook.

This match will also use our summer hours. Show up at 8AM for sign-in and we start shooting at 9AM.


## IDPA May Utah State Match

The IDPA state match is May 26th and is now a sanctioned Tier 2 match. You can [register on practiscore](https://practiscore.com/2018-utah-state-idpa-tier-2/register). The [courses of fire](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1m4hFan1TX6KGmlcj_ofdgIPjMjQarKkfBuGH86snKOI/edit?usp=sharing) are also available as well.

We do need IDPA certified safety officers for the match. If you are a certified SO please contact <leaberry@gmail.com> prior to signing up. We also have a few spots for setup staff on Thursday May 24th. If you can come work at the range for the whole day you can shoot the match on Saturday for free. Contact <leaberry@gmail.com> if you'd like to apply for these positions.

## Safety Officer Training

If you'd like to become a safety officer there will be a training course April 14th. It will be taught using the IDPA Safety Officer material. If you're an IDPA member you'll be certified to be an IDPA safety officer. Priority will be given to IDPA members. To have an IDPA state match we need more IDPA certified Safety Officers. It's not a glamorous job but we can't have matches without safety officers and there are some perks ($5 match fees!)

If you want to be IDPA certified you can't wait until the last minute to register. There is a pre-test you need to take on IDPA rules (it's open book, minimal studying needed) prior to attending the training. So sign up before April 1st.
