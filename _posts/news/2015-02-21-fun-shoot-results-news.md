The [results](/files/results/FunShoot-2015-02-17.pdf) from the last Fun Shoot have been [posted](/results/). The next Funshoot (March 4th) will involve two low light stages. Bring a tactical flashlight or weapon light if you have one. If not, a flashlight will be available for use.

The upcoming Man vs Man match (February 28th) is currently full. If you will not be attending use the link you received when signing up to unregister yourself so other people can take your spot. You should bring 300+ rounds of ammo for the match. You can always carry ammo home if you bring extra, it's hard to find more when you run out in the middle of the match.

Registration links for the March IDPA match will be available March 1st. The link will show up on the [schedule](/schedule/) page when available. This IDPA match will include the classifier as part of the match so you **must be an IDPA member** to shoot that portion. It's also the last opportunity to classify before the Utah IDPA state match in May.
