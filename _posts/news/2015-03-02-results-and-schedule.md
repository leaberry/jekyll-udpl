## IDPA Match

To shoot the IDPA match you **must** be an IDPA member. You can [join IDPA online.](https://www.idpa.com/join-now) The classifier will be part of the March match. This is our last IDPA classifier before the Utah State IDPA match in May.

The divisions have changed slightly with the new IDPA rules that took effect March 1st. SSR and ESR have been combined into a single division called REV. There is also a new division called CCP (Compact Carry Pistol). It's a provisional division so the rules might change but right now pistols the size of a Glock G19 are the max size and the magazines are loaded to 8+1. This is the perfect division for the gun you carry but don't shoot in IDPA because everyone else is shooting a long slide and you don't want to be left behind.

The highly controversial Flat Footed Reload rule has also been discontinued. You can read more about the rule changes and new divisions [on the IDPA website](http://www.idpa.com/compete/rules)
