The [Utah Shooting Sports Council](http://utahshootingsportscouncil.org/) has been working with the Bureau of Land Management to develop a shooting range at the south end of Lake Mountain in Utah County.  The BLM is moving forward with this along with Utah County and other agencies.  As development around Lake Mountain increases there is a dire need for a shooting range.

For more information on the range see the [BLM website](https://www.blm.gov/ut/enbb/index.php) and enter "Soldier Pass" into the project name field. It will have pistol and rifle bays to 300 yards and as funding allows covered shooting areas and restrooms.

Right now, until August 28th, a comment period is open. Please email/mail the BLM your comments regarding the range. Reference the *Soldier Pass Shooting Range* when submitting comments.
