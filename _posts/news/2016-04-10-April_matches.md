Two matches this month, an ICORE handgun match and a 3 gun match. As a reminder we are on summer hours now and **All matches this month start at 9AM with check-in starting at 8AM.**

## April 16th ICORE Match

ICORE matches are designed for revolver shooters but all handgun shooters are welcome to shoot the match. Generally these matches have high round counts and small steel targets so make sure you have enough ammo (recommend 400 rounds) [Register on Practiscore](https://practiscore.com/udpl-icore-april-2016/register).

## Safety Officer Training

May 14th we will be having Safety Officer training in Payson. If you have been shooting for a while and would like to be a safety officer this is a great chance to become officially certified. IDPA certified safety officers can also be safety officers for local UDPL club matches. As a safety officer you enjoy discounted match fees and help keep our matches safe and running smoothly. You must be an IDPA member to be an IDPA safety officer.

If you have no interest in IDPA but want to become a UDPL club certified safety officer you can take the course as well. You will only be certified as a Safety Officer at the local UDPL matches. If the class fills up preference will be given to IDPA members.

* Cost $20
