There were December matches, again I was lazy. I figure everyone knows how to use the schedule link on the website. However, this month has lots of announcements.

We had the steel challenge match January 1st and results took a few days to load onto practiscore but they are up now on the results page.

## January 23rd IDPA Match

There will be an IDPA match on January 23rd. The signup is open and you can [register on practiscore](https://practiscore.com/udpl-2016-january-idpa-match/register). It will most likely be cold but the match is only 6 stages so it should move along quickly. Come prepared for the weather.

## February match change and schedule changes

A big change for February's match. It will be a normal UDPL Handgun match instead of the Man on Man match. The schedule has been updated accordingly. Additionally an IDPA match has been added in March. If you haven't reviewed the schedule for the year now is a good time to do so.


## Funshoots

As always we have the Rangemasters Funshoot twice during the month. Details are in the schedule.


## Match Reminders and Etiquette

* Don't be lazy. Shooting the match involves more than just shooting. Unless you are the current shooter or the next shooter you should be helping with taping and reset. If you can't tape and reset bring someone who will do it for you and is not shooting.

* Don't jump ahead of another squad. This causes all sorts of problems. Instead help the squad tape and reset so they go faster. Have your safety officer take their shooters that have already shot and move to the next stage. Additionally the match director should always be notified when a bay is backing up. The December match had lots of issues with this and it was miserable.

* During check in we will try to even out the squads. If we ask you to move to another squad please be accommodating.

* Don't leave trash lying around. You brought it in, you carry it out. Your Safety Officer will have a large trash bag and during stage teardown make sure the stage is cleaned up.


## Garbage Man

The range is looking for someone who is willing to be the range garbage man. Your job will entail loading trash cans onto the trailer and hauling the trailer to the dump (a few miles away). The dump is only really open during 9-5 so it needs to be someone who can commit to coming during those hours. It is expected that you will make a garbage run once a month.

In return you will receive keys to the FARM range and unlimited use of a single bay most anytime you would like. You will receive log in credentials to be able to reserve one bay of your choice. You might not always get the bay you want, if it has been reserved, but some bay will be open.

Ideally this person would live fairly close to the range (Eagle Mountain, Lehi, etc...). The trailer is 6x12-ish so you will need a vehicle with a hitch. If interested contact Jim Smith (jsmith@ipaperbox.com)
