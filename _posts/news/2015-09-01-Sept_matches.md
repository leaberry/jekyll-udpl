September is filled with matches. If you want to shoot the [Idaho IDPA state match](https://clubs.practiscore.com/2015-idaho-state-idpa-championship/register) there is still time to register. We're also doing our annual night match this month with a side match for backup guns (BUG) earlier in the afternoon. If you haven't shot the night match before it is a great experience to see how your tactical lights, night sights and other equipment works at night.


## Funshoot on Sept 2nd and 15th

As always we have the Rangemasters Funshoot on Sept 2nd and 15th. Details are in the schedule.


## Sept 19th, Night and BUG matches

On practiscore these are **two seperate matches**. You will need to register twice if you plan on attending both matches.

[Register for the Night match](https://clubs.practiscore.com/udpl-sept-19th-2015-night-match/register)

For the night match it is very important you bring a small headlamp/flashlight for scoring and taping. We all have huge 500 lumen flashlights that work great for blinding people but you don't want to use that light for scoring and taping.

Additionally you **should** bring a flashlight or weapon mounted light. If your holster does not fit your handgun with a weaponlight on it don't worry, you can start at low ready. The night match usually runs until about 2-3AM so plan accordingly.

### BUG Rules

We will have two categories of BUG guns. The specifications they must meet are:

#### Semi-Automatic BUG (BUG-S)

Handguns permitted for use in BUG-S must:

* Be semi-automatic.
* Be single action, double action, double action only, or striker fired.
* Use .380 ACP or larger cartridges.
* Barrel length of 3.60” (91.4 mm) or less.
* The unloaded firearm with the heaviest magazine must weigh 29.00 oz. (822.1 grams) or less.
* Magazine length (tubes plus base pad) that extend no more than 1.0” (25.4 mm) beyond the bottom of the grip.
* In BUG semi-auto the shooter will start with one round in the chamber and 5 rounds in the magazine, and 6 rounds in each additional magazine.

#### Revolver BUG (BUG-R)

Handguns permitted for use in BUG-R must be:

* Revolver that uses 38 special or larger cartridges
* Barrel length of 3.0” (76.2 mm) or less (as measured from the front of the cylinder).
* The unloaded firearm must weigh 38.00 oz. (1077.3 grams) or less.
* Be loaded to the division capacity of six (6) rounds in the cylinder. (5 rounds is okay too, you just better be accurate).

#### Holsters

All stages will be shot from concealment and necessitate a strong side OWB or IWB holster.  Appendix carry will be permitted.  All stages will require at least one reload (magazine or speedloader) on the clock.

This is a change from the more relaxed rules we had in the past where you shot from low ready and never had to reload on the clock. If you don't have a usable holster you can start with your firearm and all magazines in a box that we will have at each station.


## Sept 26th, 3 gun match

We will have a 3 gun match Sept 26th. It will be 7-8 stages with at least one 3 gun nation classifier.
