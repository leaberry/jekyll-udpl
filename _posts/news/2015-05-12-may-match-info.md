Time for some updates on the matches this month. For the 3 Gun match the round count is 114 pistol, 66 rifle, 66 birdshot, 4 slugs. For the State IDPA match the round count is 129. As always these are the minimums, you should bring more ammo based on how accurate you are. Additionally, Courses of Fire (COFs) have been posted for the two matches ([3 Gun](http://www.udpl.net/files/cofs/2015-05-16_cof.pdf), [IDPA](http://www.udpl.net/files/cofs/2015-05-23_state_cof.pdf)).

## 3 Gun Match

This match is Pistol Caliber Carbine (PCC) friendly. If you want to substitute a rifle for a PCC make sure you registered in the PCC division. This is a great chance to shoot that 9mm AR-15, MP5 clone, or various other pistol caliber guns. Carey Palmer needs some help setting up this Friday May 15th. He'll be at the range from 9AM until dark getting the match ready. If you can spare some time on Friday just come on out to the range with a pair of gloves and help set up.

Additionally it's looking like it will rain for the match. Bring some rain gear and plan on mud in the new shooting bays that don't have gravel.

## Utah State IDPA match

Staff shoot Friday May 22nd, everyone else shoots Saturday May 23rd. Make sure you've reviewed the new 2015  IDPA rules and especially the section on equipment. It would be no fun to not read the rules and bring the wrong equipment. We will be checking holsters, concealment, and firearms to make sure they meet IDPA rules. Additionally your ammo will be chronographed to ensure you meet power factor. Leave the brass buckets at home, **this is a lost brass match** to ensure that we finish before sunset.

The State matches always have the most challenging stages and Evan Woolley has done a great job putting this match together. We're hoping for good weather.
