## IDPA May Utah State Match

The IDPA state match is May 26th and is now a sanctioned Tier 2 match. You can [register on practiscore](https://practiscore.com/2018-utah-state-idpa-tier-2/register). The [courses of fire](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1m4hFan1TX6KGmlcj_ofdgIPjMjQarKkfBuGH86snKOI/edit?usp=sharing) are also available as well.

We do need IDPA certified safety officers for the match. If you are a certified SO please contact <leaberry@gmail.com> prior to signing up. We also have a few spots for setup staff on Thursday May 24th. If you can come work at the range for the whole day you can shoot the match on Saturday for free. Contact <leaberry@gmail.com> if you'd like to apply for these positions.

Signup closes April 30th so we have time to buy the t-shirts and order plaques. Unlike the local IDPA matches you cannot try the state match. You must be an IDPA member to shoot.
