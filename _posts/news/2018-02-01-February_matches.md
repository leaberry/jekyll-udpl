February 24th is the IDPA match (with new 5x5 classifier) and the annual club meeting. The meeting will be held at 10AM prior to the match start. Also we're doing Safety Officer Training in April.

## February 24th - IDPA Match

The match will be at least 5 fun filled stages plus the new 5x5 classifier. IDPA has made some rule changes for 2018. One of them is no penalties if you shoot without moving. So if a Course of Fire calls for shots while moving you can remain still and receive no procedurals. You can [read more about it](http://www.idpa.com/blog/post/2018/01/18/No-penalty-for-not-moving-on-a-stage.aspx)

Additionally there is another shorter and simpler classifier called the [5x5 Classifier](http://www.idpa.com/compete/stagedetails/38). It's only 25 shots and requires a single target at 10 yards. As part of the match we will be shooting this new classifier. Because this classifier is much easier to setup and run we'll be having the classifier more often throughout the year.

Remember you can try out IDPA for 3 times before you need to be a member. If you aren't a member you won't be classified. IDPA is $40 a year and you can [become a member](https://www.idpa.com/join-now) by signing up online

## February 24th - Annual club meeting

The annual club membership meeting will be at 10AM out at the FARM range immediately prior to the IDPA Match. Business that will be conducted includes:

* Changes in club officers
* Club finances for the year of 2017
* Various other things

If you have questions about the general meeting or have items to discuss please raise them ahead of time with Jenn Jolly. **Text and email only please**. <jjollyudpl@gmail.com> and 801-803-3046


## 2018 Match Date Changes

No dates have changed but due to scheduling conflicts the March IDPA and April ICORE matches are swapping. So March will be an ICORE match and April an IDPA match. Check [the schedule](https://www.udpl.net/schedule) for details.


## Safety Officer Training

If you'd like to become a safety officer there will be a training course April 14th. It will be taught using the IDPA Safety Officer material. If you're an IDPA member you'll be certified to be an IDPA safety officer. Priority will be given to IDPA members. To have an IDPA state match we need more IDPA certified Safety Officers. It's not a glamorous job but we can't have matches without safety officers and there are some perks ($5 match fees!)

If you want to be IDPA certified you can't wait until the last minute to register. There is a pre-test you need to take on IDPA rules (it's open book, minimal studying needed) prior to attending the training.
