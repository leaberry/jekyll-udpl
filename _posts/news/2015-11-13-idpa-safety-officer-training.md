We will be holding IDPA safety officer training December 5th in Bountiful. If you have been shooting for a while and would like to be a safety officer this is a great chance to become officially certified. IDPA certified safety officers can also be safety officers for local UDPL club matches. As a safety officer you enjoy discounted match fees and help keep our matches safe and running smoothly. You must be an IDPA member to be an IDPA safety officer.

If you have no interest in IDPA but want to become a UDPL club certified safety officer you can take the course as well. You will only be certified to shoot at the local UDPL matches. If the class fills up preference will be given to IDPA members.

* Date: December 5th 9AM-5PM
* Location: Lions Club in Bountiful or WDSA range in Kaysville. Not decided yet.
* Cost $20
* Includes lunch
* Maximum of 12 people
