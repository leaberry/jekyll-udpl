After the Man vs Man match last month we found a missing magazine. If this looks like your magazine please contact [Michael Scott](mailto:m_g_scott@hotmail.com).

### March 21st 3 Gun match

Round count - 90 Rifle, 90 Pistol, 90 Birdshot, 5-10 slugs. These are minimums assuming no misses so plan accordingly.

There are 8 stages, with two of them being 3 Gun Nation classifiers. There are several optional targets and the longest required rifle shot is 300 yards. A bonus rifle target will be placed at 400 yards.


### March 28th IDPA match

Here is a link to the [4 stages](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1h1oeG_ogPfaAf5VgLfEJ1vh0QOKKohcT84DCoTNQ7iA/edit?usp=sharing) for this months IDPA match.

The minimum round count for the 4 defensive stages is 55+ rounds. As always the classifier is 90 rounds minimum. Bring extra for reshoots. We will have the classifier set up in 6 bays to keep things rolling. We will be using an open bay rotation. Squads with members who aren't shooting the classifier are encouraged to shoot the defensive stages first. All others squads are encouraged to find a classifier bay first.  

According to IDPA rules, participants in any Tier 2 match or higher match (such as this years Utah State IDPA Championship) must have a current IDPA classification. A classification is considered current if the competitor has either shot a classifier in the last 12 months or has participated in a tier 2 or higher sanctioned match in the last 12 months. Last year's Utah State IDPA Championship was not sanctioned and does not count toward keeping a competitor's classification current. Competitors whose classification will not be current as of the Utah State IDPA match (May 23rd) are encouraged to shoot the classifier this month.  

There are about 35 open slots left in the 2015 Utah State IDPA Championship. Participants who have registered but not paid are not guaranteed a slot in the match. Once registration has filled, those who have not paid will be moved to the waiting list so paid registrants can squad in their place. We will try to give adequate warning before this happens. However registration is expected to speed up as the registration deadline gets closer.
