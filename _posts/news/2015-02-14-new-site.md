We have a new website. Red Redford has done a great job over the last 10 years but is retiring from the website. We wanted something that maintained the useful information but was more useful to varying screen sizes and devices. The site will now reflow the layout and accomodates desktop computers to cell phones with the same look and feel.

We've also revamped the email list. If you were already on it, you still are. If you'd like to sign up you can now do so yourself using the link at the bottom of each page.
