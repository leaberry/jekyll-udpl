There have been changes. We **will have sign in** starting at 7AM. The sole purpose of which, is to receive the raffle tickets. You'll be able to view the prizes and add as many tickets to whichever prize box you desire. There will be a new shooter meeting at 7:30AM behind the clubhouse and a Safety Officer meeting at 7:45AM. If you like bullet points (and who doesn't):

* 7:00AM - Sign in opens, come by to get your raffle tickets
* 7:30AM - New shooter meeting behind the clubhouse. If it's your first time shooting with us you're a new shooter.
* 7:45AM - Safety Officer Meeting near the clubhouse.
* 8:00AM - General Safety meeting and last minute announcements.

Prizes will be drawn after the match is finished, cleaned up and all packed away. **You must be present to win any firearms.**
