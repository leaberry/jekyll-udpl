Registration is now open for the [April ICORE match](https://clubs.practiscore.com/udpl-march-icore/register). Practiscore says March ICORE match but it's really April. It will be April 25th starting at 9AM. ICORE matches are revolver friendly but open to semi-automatic shooters as well. 

### Results from March IDPA Match

The results for the [classifier](https://practiscore.com/results.php?uuid=ee4979bc-90f2-44bb-9603-2846a6055009) and the [defensive stages](https://practiscore.com/results.php?uuid=f8d63c43-312b-4553-82f5-904bc71d6321) have been posted from the March 28th IDPA match. If you didn't get a chance to shoot the classifier, and need to prior to the Utah State IDPA match, your last chance locally is the April 18th match in Kaysville with the [Wasatch Defensive Shooters](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Wasatch-Defensive-Shooters-Association/531593016867981).
