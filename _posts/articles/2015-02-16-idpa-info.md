UDPL is an [IDPA](http://www.idpa.com) affiliated club. To shoot the club IDPA matches you **must** [join IDPA](https://www.idpa.com/join-now). You are allowed to shoot one IDPA match without being a member to try it out.

## IDPA simulates Defensive Shooting

IDPA was designed to be a realistic defensive shooting competition. The firearms used are what you would use for concealed carry. Emphasis is placed on using cover and most stages require a concealment garment to simulate concealed carry.

## What to bring

To shoot in an IDPA match you should have the following

* Firearm that meets IDPA standards
* Strong side holster (no appendix, crossdraw or shoulder holsters)
* Mag carrier (max of two mags in the carrier). You can use your pockets if you want.
* Safety glasses
* Earplugs/Earmuffs
* Concealment Garment - Anything that covers your firearm while holstered and your mag carrier will work. Hawaiian shirts and photographers vests are popular choices.

If you are trying IDPA for the first time at our club you really only need the safety equipment and a firearm. That way you don't have to buy gear you don't need if you decide not to join.
