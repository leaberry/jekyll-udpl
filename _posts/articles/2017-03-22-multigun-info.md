Multigun is an exciting new type of shooting sport that uses a rifle, shotgun and pistol on various courses of fire. UDPL hosts four Multigun matches a year and one state level match. 

Due to the higher level of complexity involved in Multigun matches we require that you shoot one of our UDPL Handgun matches with us before trying your first Multigun match. 

Generally there are around 6 stages at a match.

## UDPL Multigun Divisions and Rules

**Current as of Jan 1st 2017**
