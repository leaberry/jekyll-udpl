This weekend is the Cedar Valley Multigun match which is our state level match for 3 gun. Carey Palmer and his team have worked very hard to make it an incredible match. Unlike last year where it was all crammed into one day the match will be spread over two days (Friday and Saturday). Additionally there will be AM/PM squads.

The round count is really variable due to whether you decide to shoot some sections with a pistol or shotgun. Here's the max that I counted from the [COFs](http://www.udpl.net/files/cofs/CVMG_2015.pdf). Bring more ammo if you miss.

|Pistol|163|
|Rifle|141|
|Birdshot|109|
|Slugs|12|

Some people haven't been to a split schedule match and the AM/PM PM/AM thing is confusing to them. To clarify

* AM/PM squads 101 through 105 start at 8 AM on Friday and at 11 AM on Saturday.
* PM/AM squads 201 through 205 start at 11 AM Friday and 8 AM Saturday.

There is no shooters meeting prior to the match. Be at your starting stage 20 min early, the stage brief will be read at 10 min to start time and then a five min walk through will be given. First shots will be right at the start time.

Carey will be sending out the squad matrix later today (which tells you where to start) for those that are signed up for the match. You will shoot 4 stages each day, roughly 5.5 hours each day. The last shots should be at about 5 PM. Each stage will have a trailer waiting on it and when the squad finishes we will clean up immediately while the scoring is being finalized. We would appreciate the morning squads help with this so if you leave plan to be back around 4PM on Saturday to help with tear down. The awards will be immediately after tear down and put away is complete.

There will be a food truck coming Friday **but not Saturday**, so plan accordingly. There will be plenty of water on the stages. Additionally there will be a demo bay for Amtac suppressors with a random draw for everyone that shoots the demo.


## Sponsors

This match wouldn't be nearly as impressive without the help and donations from our sponsors. Remember to think of them when you're making your purchases as they are truly interested in helping the local shooting sports grow and thrive.
