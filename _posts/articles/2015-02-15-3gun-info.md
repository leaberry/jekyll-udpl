3 Gun is an exciting new type of shooting sport that uses a rifle, shotgun and pistol on various courses of fire. UDPL hosts four 3 Gun matches a year and one state level match. 

Due to the higher level of complexity involved in 3 Gun matches we require that you shoot one of our UDPL Handgun matches with us before trying your first 3 gun match. 

Generally there are around 6 stages at a match.

## UDPL 3 Gun Divisions and Rules

**Current as of Jan 1st 2017**

[Full details](/files/3gun/3gun_rules2017.pdf) of the divisions and rules are in Section 6. Note that these have changed in 2017 with the switch to United Multigun.

### Open

This class is where anything goes as long as it's safe. If you want to swap accessories, use pistols with red dots or magazine fed shotguns then this is the class for you.

### Tactical Optics

Pistols are limited to iron sights, no porting or compensators and magazine length restrictions (171.25mm). Rifles are allowed to have one magnified optic. Shotguns are limited to tube fed with 9 rounds in the gun and no speedloaders.

### Limited

Pistols are limited to iron sights, no porting or compensators and magazine length restrictions (171.25mm). Rifles are iron sights or a non magnified red dot. Shotguns are limited to tube fed with 9 rounds in the gun and no speedloaders.

### Heavy Metal Optics

Very similar to Tactical Optics but you must use a minimum of .308 Winchester in your rifle. 

### Additional divisions

* PCC Only - Pistol Caliber Carbine must be used for the entire match
* 2x4 Gun - Minimum 2 out of 4 guns (pistol, rifle, PCC, shotgun) must be used on every stage
* 2 Gun - Must shoot pistol and rifle on every stage, no shotgun allowed

See the [Full details](/files/3gun/3gun_rules2017.pdf) of these divisions in Section 6

### UDPL Additional Rules

At local multi‐gun matches, we will have an extra division called "Other". This division will allow shooters to participate with guns that don’t meet the same specific requirements of the standard divisions. This will allow youth to participate using 22’s and 410’s.

This division will **NOT** be available for the Cedar Valley Multi Gun Match.

#### “Other” Division Considerations

* No minimum caliber or length requirements (example:  22lr, 9mm carbine, 5.7 x 28).  
* Allows the use of different guns on each stage or reconfiguring them during the match.  
* Allows for the use of suppressors.  
* **Does not allow for the use of select fire/full auto firearms.**
* The no‐steel or partially‐steel projectile rule will still apply.
* Does **not** exempt any safety rules.
