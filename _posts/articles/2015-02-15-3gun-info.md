3 Gun is an exciting new type of shooting sport that uses a rifle, shotgun and pistol on various courses of fire. UDPL hosts four 3 Gun matches a year and one state level match. 

Due to the higher level of complexity involved in 3 Gun matches we require that you shoot one of our UDPL Handgun matches with us before trying your first 3 gun match. 

Generally there are 8-10 stages at a match.

### UDPL Additional Rules

At local multi‐gun matches, we will have an extra division called "Other". This division will allow shooters to participate with guns that don’t meet the same specific requirements of the standard divisions. This will allow youth to participate using 22’s and 410’s.

This division will **NOT** be available for the Cedar Valley Multi Gun Match.

#### “Other” Division Considerations

* No minimum caliber or length requirements (example:  22lr, 9mm carbine, 5.7 x 28).  
* Allows the use of different guns on each stage or reconfiguring them during the match.  
* Allows for the use of suppressors.  
* **Does not allow for the use of select fire/full auto firearms.**
* The no‐steel or partially‐steel projectile rule will still apply.
* Does **not** exempt any safety rules.
