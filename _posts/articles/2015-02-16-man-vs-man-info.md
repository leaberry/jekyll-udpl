This competition will have two shooters that start facing matching arrays with a crossing stop plate. At the start signal, each shooter will shoot their complete array and then their stop plate. The shooter with the stop plate on the bottom will be the winner of the bout. If either shooter shoots the stop plate before their array is complete, they will be declared the loser of that bout. In the event that both shooters prematurely shoot the stop plate, the shooter with the most of their array complete will be declared winner. If both arrays match, the stop plate on the bottom will be declared winner.

A standard J ladder will be used to run each squad. At the beginning of each stage, there will be a random drawing to fill the first column of the ladder. Each pair of shooters will shoot the best two out of three. For each bout the shooter wins, they will be awarded one point. The winner will advance to the next round on the right side of the ladder. The looser will move to the left side of the ladder for the second elimination. The winner of the left side of the bracket will move over to face the winner of the right side of the ladder.

There will be a winner for each class/squad. The shooter with the most points after all stages are complete will be declared the winner. In the event of a tie, it will be decided by who won when the tied shooters met throughout the day. In the event the tie continues, the shooter that advanced the farthest in any ladder will be the tie breaker. If the tie still continues, they will shoot off best two out of three.

For this event, there will be two divisions for each of the four classes as well as a handicap system to help match up the shooters. Each class will have its own separate squad.

Divisions include:

**Limited** – No optical sights or compensators.

**Open** – Anything goes within the bounds of safety.

Classes/Squads include:

* Expert – Anyone is welcome in this class, but USPSA/ICORE "A" and higher or IDPA Master and above must compete in this class. 
  * There will be no handicapping in this class.
* Marksman – IDPA Marksman and Sharp Shooter, USPSA/ICORE "B" or "C" class fall into this category. 
  * Handicap Example:  For an Open/Limited match up, 1 plate will be put down on the Limited side.
* Amateur – USPSA/ICORE "D" class. 
  * Handicap Example:  For an Open/Limited match up, 1 plate will be put down on the Limited side.
* Novice – All other shooters, Novice or Unclassified. 
  * Handicap Example:  For an Open/Limited match up, 1 plate will be put down on the Limited side.
  
  
I’m sure many of you have questions about this match for which I will try to provide some answers. If there are some questions I don’t address below, please post them on the [UDPL Facebook page](http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=104429186260375&ref=ts) and I will check it regularly.

## Basic Match Format

The basic premise of this match is that two shooters will start facing matching arrays and the first to finish their array and has their stop plate on the bottom wins the bout. At each match up, the winner of the best two out of three bouts will advance. When a shooter loses their first matchup, they will move into the second-chance bracket to face another shooter. After a second loss, the shooter is eliminated on that stage. The three separate stages stand on their own like three separate matches. For every bout a shooter wins, they will receive 1 point. Points will be earned on BOTH sides of the J-ladder. The person with the most points on the stage will win the stage, and the person with the most overall points for all three stages will win their class. Each of the four classes/squads will stand on their own. There will be a 1st, 2nd thru 16th for each class/squad. You can find an example of the action that can be expected [here on youtube](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0USAH-Pvjas)

## FAQ

### Will I drive all the way out there only to shoot once or twice and go home? 

The answer to that is DEFINATLY NOT. There will be four separate stages with a double elimination at each stage. Even if someone shot abnormally badly and lost every bout, they would still meet up with 6 shooters best two out of three which would be at least 12 bouts. With the handicap system in place, the likelihood of losing every bout is very slim even for shooters that have just begun shooting.

### How does the point system work?

Points will be earned on both sides of the J-ladder. If you win any bout, you will earn the point for it. (There is a 2-point add-on at the second bracket on the right to balance the point system). Points are added at the end to determine the winner.

### How many rounds do I need? 

This match does not have a fixed round count because it depends on how far thru the J-ladder a shooter progresses. This can be a high round count match in excess of 300 rounds. Best estimate would be the overall winner of the stage will shoot 120 rounds on the stage and there are potentially four stages.

### Will I shoot all 4 stages?

Since each squad is its own match, the answer depends on how fast your squad progresses. We will end at 4PM. Whatever stages your squad finished will be used to determine the winner.

### How will I squad? Will I shoot with my friend? 

There will be four squads, one of each class. The squad you are in will be determined by your ability level. (Myself, I find anyone I shoot with to be my friend). Choose the squad you believe will match your ability level, but be honest with yourself.
