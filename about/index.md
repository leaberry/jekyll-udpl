## 2nd Amendment Rights

The club hopes that its members will actively work to defend our Right to Keep and Bear Arms. If we don't work to preserve our rights, who will?

Some organizations that can help us are:

* [The National Rifle Association (NRA)](http://home.nra.org/)
* [Gun Owners of America (GOA)](http://gunowners.org/)
* [National Shooting Sports Foundation (NSSF)](http://www.nssf.org/)
