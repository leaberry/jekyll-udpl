You may have shot with dozens of clubs or never shot a match, but if this is your first time shooting with us then you are a new shooter. The most important thing to remember is safety. Familiarity breeds complacency, which leads to accidents. We want everyone to be safe and have a good time.

As a new shooter you should be familiar with the operation of your firearm. You should be comfortable loading and unloading the firearm along with shooting it and holstering. You don't need to be an expert, you just need to be comfortable with basic firearm manipulations.

## Safety Details

We run a **cold range**. This means you keep your firearm holstered (or chamber flagged for a long gun) at all times. You can load magazines and do anything but remove the firearm from your holster. The only time you can remove the firearm from the holster is when you are at the shooting line and the Safety Officer has instructed you to *load and make ready.*

There are a number of safe areas around the range. At these safe areas you may handle the firearm, dry fire, disassemble, etc... **but don't handle any ammo or magazines**. When you arrive if your firearm is in a bag or case, walk over to the safe area to remove it from the case and holster the firearm.

### Common Safety Issues

* You are never timed on holstering your firearm and holstering is frequently when people have accidents. Take your time holstering your firearm, look at the holster, make sure your shirt or sweater isn't in the way. Make sure your finger is off the trigger and along the side of the firearm.

* Breaking the muzzle safety points. Each stage has either muzzle safety cones or an imaginary 180 degree line. Sometimes while reloading or moving you might twist the gun. If you move the muzzle past the limits you will be disqualified.


## General Match Info

All UDPL matches score based on time taken to shoot the match and accuracy of the shooting. Generally 0.5-2.5 seconds are added to the time for every shot that isn't as accurate as it could be. IDPA matches use more advanced scoring but the basics are the same. Shoot fast and be accurate.

### Match Etiquette

* Don't jump ahead of another squad. This causes all sorts of problems. Instead help the squad tape and reset so they go faster and have your safety officer take their shooters that have already shot and move to the next stage.

* Don't leave trash lying around. You brought it in, you carry it out.

* Don't be lazy. Shooting the match involves more than just shooting. Unless you are the current shooter or the next shooter you should be helping with taping and reset. If you can't tape and reset bring someone who will for you and is not shooting.

### Membership and Match Fees

You can join UDPL for $12.00 a year. Membership can be initiated at any match during sign in. Membership allows for discounted match pricing and voting at the yearly membership meeting on club officers and issues. **You do not need to be a UDPL member to shoot a UDPL match.**

Special matches like the IDPA state match and the Cedar Valley Multigun match will have different fee structures. See the [schedule](/schedule) for specific match details. Additionally [IDPA matches](/articles/idpa-info/) require you to be an IDPA member.

| **Match Type**  |**UDPL Member**|**Non Member**|

### Range Commands

All UDPL matches use common range commands.

* **Load and make ready**
  * You should face down range, remove your firearm from the holster, load a magazine, rack the slide so the firearm is ready to fire, engage the safety or decocker if needed, **carefully** holster the firearm.
* **Shooter ready**
  * You can respond with **Shooter Ready!** or nod your head. If you do nothing, after about 5 seconds the Safety Officer will assume you're ready. If you are not ready, say something.
* **Standby**
  * You should remain motionless in the start position, waiting the buzzer from the timer.
* **BEEP**
  * When the timer goes off you should draw your firearm and shoot the course of fire. When you are all done shooting face down range with the firearm pointed down range and remain there awaiting commands from the Safety Officer.
  * While shooting you may hear the following three commands.
* **Muzzle, Finger, Stop**
  * Muzzle - your firearm muzzle is close to a muzzle safe point. The Safety Officer is warning you. Make sure your muzzle is pointing down range.
  * Finger - Unless you are actively shooting your finger should not be on the trigger. Moving and reloading are the most common times this will be called. You should make sure your finger is outside the trigger guard, preferably above the trigger guard along the slide or frame of the firearm.
  * Stop - The Safety Officer might call stop for a number of reasons. **Stop immediately**, make sure you're facing down range and your firearm is facing down range. Wait for further commands from the Safety Officer.
* **Unload and show clear**
  * You should remove the magazine from your firearm and stow it. Rack the slide to remove the chambered round. Check to make sure the chamber is empty then lock the slide back so the Safety Officer can also verify the chamber is empty.
* **Slide forward, pull the trigger, holster**
  * After the Safety Officer verifies the firearm is clear you will drop the slide, then pointing the firearm down range, pull the trigger, then holster the firearm.
* **Range is Clear**
  * It is now clear to go down range and score the targets, tape them, and reset the stage for the next shooter.

### Example Stage Walkthrough

Bob is shooting a UDPL Handgun match. There are 8 paper targets and 2 steel targets. The course of fire (CoF) calls for 2 shots on each paper target and hitting the steel targets with one shot.

* Bob is listening for his name to be called. The Scorekeeper or Safety Officer will call out the next 3 shooters after each shooter finishes shooting the stage. While waiting, Bob is helping to tape paper targets and reset steel targets so the match progresses quickly.

* Bob is called to the shooting line. He has his magazines all loaded and he is mentally prepared to shoot the stage.

* The safety officer runs Bob through the range commands and Bob shoots the stage

* The safety officer will make sure Bob unloads his firearm, clears it, and holsters.

* The range will be called *Clear* and the Scorekeeper and Safety Officer will score the targets. Bob should check the targets with the Safety Officer and Scorekeeper to ensure he is clear on the scoring. Other shooters will be taping the targets after they are scored.

* Bob shoots the stage in 30 seconds. The shot timer records each shot taken so the end time is the time of your last shot. Scoring the targets Bob realizes he completely missed two shots on the paper targets. His final time will be 35 seconds (2.5 seconds for each missed paper shot).

## Range Info

[Directions](http://maps.google.com/maps?ll=40.218331,-112.124469&z=15&t=h&hl=en&gl=US&mapclient=embed&daddr=40%C2%B013%2707.0%22N%20112%C2%B007%2736.2%22W@40.218626,-112.126724)

The range is located at [The Farm](http://www.farmpolice.com) near Fairfield, UT. There are 3 miles of dirt roads but they are passable in a standard passenger car. There are no garbage cans, no running water, and only portable toilets. Plan to carry out everything you bring to the range.

## Weather

Weather in Utah can be unpredictable. You should be prepared to spend 8+ hours outside during a match. In the summer we recommend 1 gallon of water per person, sunscreen and a hat. During the winter you will need boots, jacket, gloves and a hat. If it rains, a full set of raingear is very handy, especially if it's cold. We almost never cancel a match due to the weather.

These include the Super Shoot, Steel Challenge, Man vs Man, ICORE and other variants. These matches are open to all with no additional membership needed to shoot the match. Round count is around 300 rounds. Generally there are 8-10 stages in a match.

3 Gun is the newest type of shooting sport and uses a rifle, shotgun and pistol. Most stages use two of the three firearms at a time.

Round counts can vary, each match will have a description of the recommended round count. Generally there are 8-10 stages in a match.
